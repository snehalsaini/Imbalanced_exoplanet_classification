# Imbalanced_data_exoplanet_classification
Finding habitable exoplanets among PHL dataset

Most of the astronomical datasets collected from satellites and telescopes are unbalanced or limited, to perform training and get adequate accuracy through machine learning or deep learning classifiers. While working in an imbalanced domain, accuracy is not an appropriate measure to evaluate model performance. Since, the algo could  correctly classify majority class but would wrongly classify minority class despite an accuracy of 99% with minority class event rate = 1%, which makes the model of no use to us in such cases.
Thus, we try to solve the problem using two different approaches:
## SMOTE
## Anomaly Detection
